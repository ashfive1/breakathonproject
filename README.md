# TaskFlow

The TaskFlow uses an AI algorithm to sort out suitable contracts for free lancers who are looking to collaborate or work on unfinished projects submitted by partners for assistance.

## Features

1. Verification of credentials: Attesting digitally signed documents while creation of profile by free lancers provides a bronze badge. Ideally, one must mail their necessary document copies via post to nearby hotspot quarters of the firm for verification and profile creation. 

2. Technical capability of free lancers: Free lancers are encouraged to solve sample projects/problems through a built in "CodeFlow", to gain "Task Points", which would grant them badges at certain milestones. Higher tier of badge would mean a higher tier of reputation and skill level. The projects would be tailored with a parameter on skill level on TaskPoints.

3. Reputation of partners: Partners are awarded "Reputation Points" with proper feedback recieved on completion of a project by a freelancer. This would provide insight on a company's provision for it's workers. 

4. A "for you page": Each free lancer is asked specific details on account creation about their expectations on a company, such as salary expectation, availability for work, fields of specialty, qualification, work experiences. A list of jobs is fed to the page of free lancers by the algorithm based on the "Sync Score" attained between the partner and the free lancer. 

5. A digital contract: After a free lancer wishes to collaborate with the partner, they are meant to send a request to the partner, which would be reviewed by a team on their side and after approval, a contract is signed, officially bringing in the free lancer into an existing team or as a solo venture to complete the project. 

6. Expectations of the partners: The requesting firms are given an opportunity to add details of projects, such as number of required people on team, pay of salary, future ventures, domain of the project, along with expected credentials of free lancers. These are parameters which are fed into the algorithm so that they can be matched for sync with the other end to find a suitable team/lancer.

7. The CodeFlow section of the TaskFlow project serves as a critical analysis of technical skill of the free lancers. The more Task Points a user has, the wider spectrum of projects are suggested to the said user. Similarly, the more Reputation Points a partner has, the more options they would be given to customize as the requirement for the team, and the more skill they can request.

8. Using HTML + CSS as front-end and csv as back-end, and flask as a medium to connect then

## Why use this?

As important as github is to software design and programme development, fiverr has been a free lancing site. But it does not provide a trustable reputation as there is no way to verify the skills of service providers other than their buy count. On the contrary, newer users of fiverr would not be given much publicity as people would not wish the services of people with low visit count. A bad algorithm used in such websites prove as a disadvantage and a waste of skill. TaskFlow promises to turn the tables and improve ways in which innovation can be bought without a factor of "luck".

## Why we built this?

2 years back, a good friend of mine in architecture had a huge project in his hands which could turn his life around, gaining him tons of reputation and visibility in the industry. But, his team was stretched thin and there were plenty of tight deadlines. Without a proper opportunity to collaborate with free lancers, and unreliable external free lancers, eventually, lots of deadlines were broken, and the agreement was broken between him and the firm. This hit hard, knowing that steps could be taken to prevent and that a good man lost a project which could potentially improve his career by a lot. This inspired me and my team to build a project which would solve this issue and make sure something like that never happens. True story.

## Deployment instructions

The AI algorithm is stored in "algo.py" and the flask connection in "app.py". With a website (which is unstable due to lots of heavy training) driven by 10 hours of sheer caffeine blood, the app.py is meant to be run with vscode or any python interpreter, with the necessary modules (flask, scipy, pandas) installed.


## Extra information 

This project made me realize how much of caffeine I could intake without facing any high. I was looking forward to present in front of the team, but this works too. Cheers!
